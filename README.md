# Enterprise Development

This repository is a project for my enterprise development course. The goal of this porject was to create a java api consisting of a minimum of 3 microservices, this api would have an api-gateway to be able to use authentication, next the api would be deployed on okteto using Docker containers, finally unit test would be implemented to test the api before deployement to prevent deployment hell. Extra credit could be gained by do extra tasks such as creating a frontend, changing the docker-compose to a kubernetes manifest and more. The frontend I create for my extra credit can be found here https://enterprise-dev-frontend.vercel.app/ .

## 1. Microservices

The first part of this project is the 3 microservices.
